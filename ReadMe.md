# Adjustable Dirt Chance
Allows you to adjust the chance that dirt (and all forms of filth) will spawn when the game attempts to create it, in and outside the home area. Range is 0-100, with 0 meaning never, and 100 meaning always.
Vanilla behavior is 100%, but this mod changes it to default to a 0% chance for all types of filth. Should work with any mods that add filth as long as this is loaded under that mod and it uses BaseFilth for its added filth.

Chinese translation by BOS天际分队: 的汉化，通过该mod玩家可以对灰尘生成概率进行设置，从而避免过于频繁的灰尘清理工作，可以对各种灰尘类型设置，来达到个性化的需求。 默认对灰尘生成进行全局设置。
